Having graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University with a BSc (Hons) in Computer Games Technology and a MSC in Data Science, I spend my time experimenting with the cutting edge in game development tools, entering various GameJam's and hosting DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) sessions.

Since leaving higher education, I have most recently taken on a role as a Junior C# Developer within Sparta Global; which later lead to a move to SDET.

I am looking for the next challange that will allow me to further develop my skills, I am a strong collaborator and always seize the chance to innovate.
